Intro: A

A                      E          Bm
What would you think if I sang out of tune
                 E                                    A
Would you stand up and walk out on me
A                  E              Bm
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
         E                              A
And I'll try not to sing out of key.-


             G                    D                    A
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
                 G                     D               A
Mmm I get high with a little help from my friends
                        G                   D          A
Mmm I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
G  D  A      (D)
uh uh uh.-


What do iI do when my love is away
(Does it worry you to be alone)
How do I feel by the end of the day
(Are you sad because you're on your own).-


No, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm I get high with a little help from my friends
Mmm I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.-


Puente: A C# E F#m

F#m                           F#m E C# A
Do you need anybody
                                        A C# E F#m
I need somebody to love

Could it be anybody
                               E
I want somebody to love


Would you believe in a love at first sight
Yes I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.-


Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm I get high with a little help from my friends
Oh I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends.-


Do you need anybody
I just need somebody to love
Could it be anybody
I want somebody to love


sobre G D A

Oh I get by with a little help from my friends
Mmm I´m gonna try with a little help from my friends
Oh I get high with a little help from my friends
Yes I get by with a little help from my friends
With a little help from my friends
